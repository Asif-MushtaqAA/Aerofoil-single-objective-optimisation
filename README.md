# Aerofoil-single-objective-optimisation
Aerofoil optimisation for increasing L/D ratio using Modified Cuckoo Search algorithm and several modes

Modes available:  
1. DNN-Driven CFD Framework (DDF)  
In this mode, the DNN model drives the optimisation process, with periodic CFD evaluations to assure accuracy. Specifically, CFD validation is performed on every fifth and final five generations of the optimisation process. This strategy provides high fidelity by using the CFD solver intermittently, ensuring that the results remain accurate throughout the optimisation process while avoiding the computational cost of constant CFD evaluations.

2. DNN-Only Framework (DOF)  
To further accelerate the optimisation, a DNN-only mode, where the DNN model predicts aerodynamic performance throughout the optimisation process. This mode provides a lightweight option with substantially lower computational overhead while retaining reasonable accuracy in most cases.

3. DNN-Initialised Framework (DIF)  
In this mode, DNN predicted flow field is used to initialise the CFD solver for every design case evaluation.  

4. CFD-based Framework (FF)  
A pure CFD based optimisation approach.
